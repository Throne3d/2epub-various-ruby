From Python version:
* Testing on Linux seems to show that it still works (with the new hopefully-Windows-compatible file-naming system)
* Find a better way to handle the "discretion advised" warning. Ugh.
* Ensure the new "save the previous epub generation and use it where applicable" system functions properly (seems to for now! :D).
* Test the new "fix changed icons" thing (so if you have epub HTML loaded (from flats, actually, not just epub), it'll update icons to the most recent)
  - It doesn't die on finding an icon that *hasn't* changed
  - It's untested on finding an icon that *has* changed
